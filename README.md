# customer_strategy_03_c
 
A **customer** is placed in either of three categories: 
**Bronze** customers: pay the full price on every item bought, plus shipping costs.
**Silver** customers: get 10% reduction on every item bought, plus shipping costs.
**Gold** customers: get 20 % reduction on every item bought, and free shipping.

Write a program that calculates the final price of an item, taking into account the customer's category

**Input**: 
- name and type of customer (gold, silver, bronze)
- price of the purchased good

**Output**:
- final price 

**Requirements**
- use a data structure to store the user's essential data (at least the name and category). 
- the newCustomer() function will take care of the Customer data input and make the appropriate data structure 
- the calculation of the final cost must be performed by the function computePrice()
